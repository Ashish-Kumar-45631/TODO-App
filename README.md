# TODO App 

TODO app is a simple React application designed to manage tasks efficiently. The app features three main components: `List`, `Todo`, and `Form`. Users can add new tasks and remove existing ones, with all updates immediately reflected in the user interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic Task Management**:  
  The app initially loads with three default tasks. Users can add new tasks by entering text into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. The new task is then added to the list of existing tasks.

- **Task Removal**:  
  Each task in the list comes with a "Remove" button. Clicking this button removes the corresponding task from the list and updates the display accordingly.

- **Responsive UI**:  
  The app renders the input textbox, "Add" button, and task list container correctly, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
